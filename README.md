# Maze
A classic get out of maze game made with SFML. My first project with SFML. It has one maze only. Use arrow keys to move the ball.

Bug#1: The ball sometimes glitches through a wall.

Bug#2: The ball can go out of the window through the bottom and right window boundaries.

Mising Feature: The game does not announce victory.
